      Penguins are a group of aquatic flightless birds. They live almost
      exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere: only one species, the Galápagos
      penguin, is found north of the Equator. Highly adapted for life in the
      water, penguins have counter shaded dark and white plumage and flippers
      for swimming
