1. Create an object called "car" with the following properties:

   "make" (string)
   "model" (string)
   "year" (number)
   "color" (string)
   "isRunning" (boolean)
   Then, add the following methods to the "car" object:

   "start" which changes the "isRunning" property to true
   "stop" which changes the "isRunning" property to false
   "getAge" which returns the age of the car (i.e. the difference between the current year and the "year" property)
